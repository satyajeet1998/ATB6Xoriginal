    //fixed size of array
    //in the same object of new key word we can not increase the size of array.for that we need to create a new object
    //like arr=new int[10]//we are creting a second object.
    //arr.sort() is not there(no in build method)
    //a-1000 array crete n store 2 array then memery will be wasted.
    //insertion means 23,34,56 and i want to insert new number then one by one i need go till 56 then i can insert and if
    //i want to delete sam e i need to go one by one in order to detlete the array.
    //sorting n serching functionality not availblew in array trhat is the problem n to overcome from this

    //to overcome from array java creted some legacy classes
    //collection vs collections-
    //collection holds both interface amnd classes .
    //collection-list,set and queue(collection means how u can store the element)
